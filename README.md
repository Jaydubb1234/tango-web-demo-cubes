Simple Demo for WebVR on Google Tango

## What's this?

This demo shows how to use the [WebVR](http://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/webvr.html) APIs (specifically the [PositionSensorVRDevice](http://mozvr.github.io/webvr-spec/webvr.html#positionsensorvrdevice)) to move around in a virtual 3D space.

[Here's a demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHj1RLYb_4U)
